## GraalVM Rules for Bazel

> Project Structure & Governance

This project is an open source collaboration amongst individual developers. The project is loosely governed by the stakeholders who use it. Development is active and responsive as of 2024.

See below for GitHub users who you can contact about this project.

### Project Governance

**Sam Gammon (Lead, @sgammon)**
Sam works for [Elide](https://elide.dev), and forked this repo to create the modern ruleset. Sam does most maintenance and feature development, with lots of help from @fmeum.

**Fabian Meumertzheim (Co-lead, @fmeum)**
Fabian does open source work and additionally builds the Code Intelligence organization on Github. He's an active contributor to many Bazel projects and a reviewer on BCR.

### How project structure evolves

If you use this project for something important, we'll happily add you to the repo so you can ship changes (with code review, of course). Please file a PR adding yourself to this document as a collaborator.

### Where we collaborate

We generally talk in the Bazel Slack.
